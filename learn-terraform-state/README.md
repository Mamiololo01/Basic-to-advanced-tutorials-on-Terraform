# Learn Terraform State Management

This repo is a companion repo to the [Learn Terraform State Management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/state-cli) tutorial.
It contains Terraform configuration you can use to learn how to create an AWS instance and security group, examine a state file, and then manipulate resources to observe how vital state is to your Terraform operations.

Manage Resources in Terraform State

Terraform

Terraform stores information about your infrastructure in a state file. This state file keeps track of resources created by your configuration and maps them to real-world resources.

In this tutorial, you will create an AWS instance and security group, examine a state file, and then manipulate resources to observe how vital state is to your Terraform operations.

Terraform compares your configuration with the state file and your existing infrastructure to create plans and make changes to your infrastructure. When you run terraform apply or terraform destroy against your initialized configuration, Terraform writes metadata about your configuration to the state file and updates your infrastructure resources accordingly.

Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the usual Terraform plan/apply workflow. If you are new to Terraform, refer first to the Getting Started tutorial.

For this tutorial, you will need:

The Terraform CLI 1.1.5+ installed locally
An AWS account
The AWS CLI installed
Your AWS credentials configured locally with your access keys and a default region.
Note

This tutorial will provision resources that qualify under the AWS free-tier. If your account doesn't qualify under the AWS free-tier, we're not responsible for any charges that you may incur.

Create infrastructure and state
Clone the Learn Terraform State Management repository.

 git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-state.git
Copy
Change into the new directory.

 cd learn-terraform-state
Copy
Review the main.tf file. This configuration deploys an Ubuntu EC2 instance publicly accessible on port 8080.

Examine the state file
Now that you have applied this configuration, you have a local state file that tracks the resources Terraform created. Check your directory to confirm the terraform.tfstate file exists.

 ls
README.md
main.tf
terraform.tfstate
new_state/
Copy
You should not manually change information in your state file in a real-world situation to avoid unnecessary drift between your Terraform configuration, state, and infrastructure. Any change in state could result in your infrastructure being destroyed and recreated at your next terraform apply.

Warning

Do not manually modify state files.

Open the terraform.tfstate file in your file editor.

This example contains few resources, so your actual state file is relatively small.

This file is the JSON encoded state that Terraform writes and reads at each operation. The first stanza contains information about your Terraform application.

Explore resources in state
The resources section of the state file contains the schema for any resources you create in Terraform. Review the resources section of this file.

"resources": [
 {
      "mode": "data",
      "type": "aws_ami",
      "name": "ubuntu",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "schema_version": 0,
          "attributes": {
            "architecture": "x86_64",
            "arn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1::image/ami-0b287e7832eb862f8",
      ##...
    },
    ##...
]
The first key in this schema is the mode. Mode refers to the type of resource Terraform creates â€” either a resource (managed) or a data source (data). The type key refers to the resource type - in this case, the aws_ami type is a resource available in the aws provider.

##...
{
  "mode": "managed",
  "type": "aws_instance",
  "name": "example",
  "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
  "instances": [
    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "attributes": {
        "ami": "ami-0b287e7832eb862f8",
        "arn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:561656980159:instance/i-01d757a22e0685a10",
        "associate_public_ip_address": true,
        "availability_zone": "us-east-1c",
        ##...
        "public_ip": "3.18.101.45",
        ##...
        "secondary_private_ips": [],
        "security_groups": [
          "terraform-learn-state-sg"
        ],
        "source_dest_check": true,
        "subnet_id": "subnet-7ae38e36",
        "tags": {
          "Name": "terraform-learn-state-ec2"
        },
        ##...
      }
    }
  ]
},
The aws_instance type is a managed resource with the AMI from the data.aws_ami source.

The instances section in this resource contains the attributes of the resource. The security_groups attribute, for example, is captured in plain text in state as opposed to the variable interpolated string in the configuration file.

Terraform also marks dependencies between resources in state with the built-in dependency tree logic.

##...
          "dependencies": [
            "aws_security_group.sg_8080",
            "data.aws_ami.ubuntu"
          ]
##...
Because your state file has a record of your dependencies, enforced by you with a depends_on attribute or by Terraform automatically, any changes to the dependencies will force a change to the dependent resource.

Examine State with CLI
The Terraform CLI allows you to review resources in the state file without interacting with the .tfstate file itself. This is how you should interact with your state.

Run terraform show to get a human-friendly output of the resources contained in your state.

 terraform show
 aws_instance.example:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami                          = "ami-0b287e7832eb862f8"
    arn                          = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:561656980159:instance/i-01d757a22e0685a10"
    associate_public_ip_address  = true
#...
}

 aws_security_group.sg_8080:
resource "aws_security_group" "sg_8080" {
    arn                    = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:561656980159:security-group/sg-0096a764b1e76f7fd"
    description            = "Managed by Terraform"
#...
}

 data.aws_ami.ubuntu:
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
    architecture          = "x86_64"
    arn                   = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1::image/ami-0b287e7832eb862f8"
#...
}

Outputs:

instance_id = "i-05fc3562ca25ee77c"
public_ip = "3.18.101.45"
security_group = "sg-0096a764b1e76f7fd"
Copy
Run terraform state list to get the list of resource names and local identifiers in your state file. This command is useful for more complex configurations where you need to find a specific resource without parsing state with terraform show.

 terraform state list
data.aws_ami.ubuntu
aws_instance.example
aws_security_group.sg_8080
Copy
Replace a resource with CLI
Terraform usually only updates your infrastructure if it does not match your configuration. You can use the -replace flag for terraform plan and terraform apply operations to safely recreate resources in your environment even if you have not edited the configuration, which can be useful in cases of system malfunction. Replacing a resource is also useful in cases where a user manually changes a setting on a resource or when you need to update a provisioning script. This allows you to rebuild specific resources and avoid a full terraform destroy operation on your configuration. The -replace flag allows you to target specific resources and avoid destroying all the resources in your workspace just to fix one of them.

In older versions of Terraform, you may have used the terraform taint command to achieve a similar outcome. That command has now been deprecated in favor of the -replace flag, which allows for a simpler, less error-prone workflow. If you are using an older version of Terraform, consider upgrading or review the taint documentation for more information.

Tip

The -replace flag was introduced in Terraform 0.15.2. Ensure you are using the correct version of Terraform for this next step.

Run terraform plan -replace="aws_instance.example" to see the actions Terraform would take if you replaced the instance.

 terraform plan -replace="aws_instance.example"

  ~ instance_id = "i-0c4f9abb21cf15fca" -> (known after apply)
  ~ public_ip   = "18.191.48.245" -> (known after apply)
Copy
As shown in the output, when you apply this change, Terraform will destroy your running instance and create a new one.

Run terraform apply with the -replace flag to force Terraform to destroy and recreate the resource.

 terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example"
aws_security_group.sg_8080: Refreshing state... [id=sg-08a985b4f14d50fdc]

  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
Copy
Type yes when prompted to accept this update.

Using the terraform apply command with the -replace flag is the HashiCorp-recommended process for managing resources without manually editing your state file.

Move a resource to a different state file
Some of the Terraform state subcommands are useful in very specific situations. HashiCorp recommends only performing these advanced operations as the last resort.

The terraform state mv command moves resources from one state file to another. You can also rename resources with mv. The move command will update the resource in state, but not in your configuration file. Moving resources is useful when you want to combine modules or resources from other states, but do not want to destroy and recreate the infrastructure.

The new_state subdirectory contains a new Terraform configuration. This configuration creates a new EC2 instance named aws_instance.example_new and uses a data resource to use the same security group from your root configuration file. Change into the subdirectory.

 cd new_state
Copy
Copy your terraform.tfvars file from your root directory.

cp ../terraform.tfvars .

Run terraform init.

Copy
Now, you have a second state file with a managed resource and a data source.

Move the new EC2 instance resource you just created, aws_instance.example_new, to the old configuration's file in the directory above your current location, as specified with the -state-out flag. Set the destination name to the same name, since in this case there is no resource with the same name in the target state file.

 terraform state mv -state-out=../terraform.tfstate aws_instance.example_new aws_instance.example_new
Move "aws_instance.example_new" to "aws_instance.example_new"
Successfully moved 1 object(s).
Copy
Note

Resource names must be unique to the intended state file. The terraform state mv command can also rename resources to make them unique.

Change into your root directory.

 cd ..
Copy
Run terraform state list to confirm that the new EC2 instance, aws_instance.example_new, is present in the in original configuration's state file.

 terraform state list
data.aws_ami.ubuntu
aws_instance.example
aws_instance.example_new
aws_security_group.sg_8080
Copy
Without adding the EC2 resource you moved, plan the configuration as is. Because the new EC2 instance is present in state but not in the configuration, Terraform plans to destroy the moved instance, and remove the resource from the state file.

 terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

   aws_instance.example_new will be destroyed
   (because aws_instance.example_new is not in configuration)

#...
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
Copy
Open the main.tf file in your root directory. Copy and paste the resource definition below.

Apply your configuration. Your configuration now matches your state file and Terraform will not perform any changes.

 terraform apply
#...

Your configuration already matches the changes detected above. If you'd like to
update the Terraform state to match, create and apply a refresh-only plan:
  terraform apply -refresh-only

Copy
Change into your new_state directory.

 cd new_state
Copy
Run terraform destroy and you should have no resources to destroy. Your security_group resource is a data source and you moved the aws_instance resource to another state file. Accept the changes by typing yes when prompted.

 terraform destroy

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes


Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed.
Copy
Remove a resource from state
The terraform state rm subcommand removes specific resources from your state file. This does not remove the resource from your configuration or destroy the infrastructure itself.

Change into your root directory.

 cd ..
Copy
Remove your security_group resource from state.

 terraform state rm aws_security_group.sg_8080
Removed aws_security_group.sg_8080
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
Copy
Confirm the change by reviewing the state with terraform state list.

 terraform state list
data.aws_ami.ubuntu
aws_instance.example
Copy
The removed security_group resource does not exist in the state, but the resource still exists in your AWS account.

Run terraform import to bring this security group back into your state file. Removing the security group from state did not remove the output value with its ID, so you can use it for the import.

 terraform import aws_security_group.sg_8080 $(terraform output -raw security_group)
aws_security_group.sg_8080: Importing from ID "sg-0096a764b1e76f7fd"...
aws_security_group.sg_8080: Import prepared!
  Prepared aws_security_group for import
aws_security_group.sg_8080: Refreshing state... [id=sg-0096a764b1e76f7fd]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
Copy
Note

If you were to apply the configuration before importing your resource back into state, Terraform would create a new resource, and your original infrastructure would keep running until you manually removed it.

Refresh modified infrastructure
The terraform refresh command updates the state file when physical resources change outside of the Terraform workflow.

Delete the original EC2 instance from your AWS account using the AWS CLI or the AWS Console. It may take a few moments for AWS to destroy your instance.

 aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids $(terraform output -raw instance_id)
{
    "TerminatingInstances": [
        {
            "InstanceId": "i-05fc3562ca25ee77c",
            "CurrentState": {
                "Code": 32,
                "Name": "shutting-down"
            },
            "PreviousState": {
                "Code": 16,
                "Name": "running"
            }
        }
    ]
}
Copy
By deleting this piece of infrastructure, you have created a difference between your state and the real-world resources mapped to it. The state file no longer reflects the reality of your environment. It may take up to five minutes for AWS to destroy your instance.

Run the terraform refresh command to update your state file.

 terraform refresh
aws_security_group.sg_8080: Refreshing state... [id=sg-0f9a2681ee66d50e4]
aws_instance.example: Refreshing state... [id=i-048a9db19e06dae27]
#...
Copy
Run terraform state list to confirm Terraform deleted the original aws_instance.example resource from state.

 terraform state list
data.aws_ami.ubuntu
aws_instance.example_new
aws_security_group.sg_8080
Copy
Tip

Your outputs still exist because Terraform stores them separately from your resources.

Your state file now reflects reality. You deleted the aws_instance.example and the terraform refresh command removed it from state.

The terraform refresh command does not update your configuration file. Run terraform plan to review the proposed infrastructure updates.

 terraform plan

aws_security_group.sg_8080: Refreshing state... [id=sg-01b4904a558bcf6b2]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  - instance_id = "i-010842178d90cd858" -> null
  - public_ip   = "3.133.127.249" -> null

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

security_group = "sg-01b4904a558bcf6b2"
Copy
Notice that Terraform changed the outputs and did not destroy any infrastructure.

Note

Terraform automatically performs a refresh during the plan, apply, and destroy operations. All of these commands will reconcile state by default, and have the potential to modify your state file.

Destroy your infrastructure
Terraform also updates your state file when you run a terraform destroy operation.

Destroy your infrastructure. Accept the changes by typing yes when prompted.

 terraform destroy

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:
#...
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  - security_group = "sg-01b4904a558bcf6b2" -> null

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.


  Enter a value: yes

aws_security_group.sg_8080: Destroying... [id=sg-01b4904a558bcf6b2]

Your terraform.tfstate file still exists, but does not contain any resources. Run terraform show to confirm. You should not receive an output.

 terraform show
Copy
Open the terraform.tfstate file in your file editor. The empty resources attribute confirms Terraform destroyed all your previous resources.

Next steps
In this tutorial, you created an EC2 Ubuntu instance and corresponding security group. Then, you examined your local state file and used terraform state to move, remove, and modify your resources across multiple configurations.
